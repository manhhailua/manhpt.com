# Privacy Policy for IntelliLead Finder Chrome Extension

**Last Updated: May 25, 2025**

IntelliLead Finder ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our IntelliLead Finder Chrome Extension (the "Extension"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not install or use the Extension.

## About IntelliLead Finder

IntelliLead Finder is an intelligent assistant that optimizes the process of connecting with potential customers (prospecting) on Facebook. It allows users to easily discover, store, and manage useful contact information from public sources they browse.

Key features include:
- **Quick Information Gathering**: Save important information from personal profiles, group members, and post interactors (publicly) in an organized way with just one click.
- **Smart Analysis (AI)**: Integrates Artificial Intelligence (LLM) to evaluate and identify high-potential contacts that align with your business goals, helping you prioritize the right people.
- **Flexible Data Export**: Convert contact lists to CSV files in seconds, or seamlessly sync with Google Drive and Airtable for centralized management, without interrupting your workflow.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy to use, smoothly integrated into your daily Facebook browsing experience.

## Information We Collect

The Extension helps you organize information that you see publicly on Facebook. We **do not** collect or store any personal data from your Facebook account or the data you collect using the extension's core prospecting features on our servers, unless explicitly stated below.

Specifically:
- **Authentication Information & Guest Mode**: IntelliLead Finder offers a Guest Mode that can be used without logging in and does not involve the collection of your personal information. For enhanced features and to track usage for different tiers, you have the option to log in via your Google account, a process facilitated by Firebase Authentication. When you choose to authenticate, we collect and store your email address. This email address is used as a unique identifier for your account if you log in. Importantly, this login process is independent of and does not extract or access any information from your Facebook account.
- **Data You Collect (Prospecting Data)**: Information you choose to save using the Extension's core features (e.g., contact details from public Facebook profiles) is stored locally in your browser's storage or exported to services you designate (like Google Drive or Airtable, subject to their respective privacy policies). We do not have access to this prospecting data, regardless of whether you are in Guest Mode or logged in.
- **Usage Data**: We may collect anonymous, aggregated usage statistics to improve the Extension (e.g., feature usage frequency). This data does not contain any personally identifiable information.
- **AI Analysis**: When using the Smart Analysis feature, the textual data you select for analysis might be sent to a third-party Large Language Model (LLM) API for processing. We do not store this data after the analysis is complete. Please refer to the privacy policy of the LLM provider for more information on how they handle data.

## How We Use Your Information

- **Guest Mode**: If you use IntelliLead Finder in Guest Mode, we do not collect or use any personal information. All functionalities related to prospecting data operate locally on your device.
- **Local Functionality (All Modes)**: The prospecting information you gather is used solely to provide the Extension's core features locally on your device or in the services you connect.
- **Account Management and Usage Tracking (Logged-in Users Only)**: If you choose to log in, your email address is used to:
    - Manage your account and provide access to the Extension's tiered features.
    - Track your usage of the Extension's features.
    - Enforce usage limits based on your subscription tier (rate limiting).
    - Communicate important information regarding your account or the Extension.
- **Improvement of Service**: Anonymous and aggregated usage data helps us understand how the Extension is used, identify areas for improvement, and enhance user experience.

## Disclosure of Your Information

We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. As stated, the data you collect is stored locally or in services you control.
Anonymous, aggregated usage data may be shared with third-party service providers to help us operate and improve the Extension, but this will not include any personal data.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information handled by the Extension. However, since the data is primarily stored locally on your device, the security of that data is also your responsibility. For data exported to third-party services like Google Drive or Airtable, their respective security measures and privacy policies apply.

## User Responsibilities

You are responsible for using the IntelliLead Finder Extension in compliance with Facebook's Terms of Service and applicable laws. The Extension is designed to help organize publicly available information. Please use it responsibly.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.
